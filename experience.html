<font color="purple" size="3" face="arial"> Hi guys, i would like to share for you about my experiece that happended in all my life.
 So guys, first of all of course about my family. My father was died when i was 12 years old and my mother was died when i was 1 years old. In all my life had no parents to i share something, to i need someting.
 I did all that myselft, that things i want everyting do it for myself. I have grandmother and grandfather, they take care of me all in my life untill i grew up now. 
 After that, my grandfather was died on on 2020 when i was 18 years old. I felt soo sad, i have no more tears to cry. I keep going in my life even everyone that i love was died.
